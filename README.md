# Portfolio Project: H Plus Sport Order Summary Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio project showcasing the H Plus Sport Order Summary Dashboard. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and web-based dashboard development using Python, SQL, and web frameworks such as Dash.

### Project Highlights

- **Data Source:** Utilized the HPlusSport database, connecting to it using SQLAlchemy to extract data from the `V_CustomerOrderSummary` view.

- **Data Analysis:** Employed the pandas library for data manipulation and exploration, gaining insights into key metrics such as total sales, average due amounts, minimum due amounts, and maximum due amounts for different states.

- **Visualization:** Leveraged Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects to create an interactive bar chart representing total sales by state. The visualization is integrated into a dynamic dashboard developed with Dash.

- **Web-Based Dashboard:** Developed a responsive web-based dashboard using Dash, allowing users to explore different aspects of the H Plus Sport Order Summary data, including the ability to switch between total sales, average sales, minimum sales, and maximum sales.
